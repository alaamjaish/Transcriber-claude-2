# 🎯 AI Tutor Feature - Complete Design Summary

## 🧠 **Core Concept**

**Personal AI Brain for Each Student**
- Each student gets a persistent AI assistant that knows their complete learning history
- The AI maintains context of the last 30 lessons (summaries + homework)
- Tutor can chat with the AI to get insights, suggestions, lesson plans, and next steps
- AI is trained on a customizable teaching methodology/curriculum structure

---

## 📊 **Context Window Strategy**

### **What Gets Fed to AI Every Interaction:**
1. **Base Instructions** (hardcoded) - AI's role, behavior guidelines
2. **Teaching Methodology** (user-customizable) - Curriculum structure, teaching principles
3. **Last 30 Lessons** (dynamic) - Recent student progress, summaries, homework
4. **Conversation History** (session-based) - Previous messages in current chat session
5. **User's Current Question** - What the tutor is asking right now

### **Token Economics:**
- Each lesson: ~3,000 tokens (summary + homework)
- 30 lessons: ~90,000 tokens
- Teaching methodology: ~10-20,000 tokens
- **Total context per message: ~100-110k tokens**
- **Cost per AI interaction: ~$0.01-0.02 (pennies!)**

### **Why This Works:**
- NO compression needed - just fetch fresh every time
- Gemini re-reads all 30 lessons each interaction (so cheap it doesn't matter)
- Always up-to-date context
- Simple architecture, no complex memory management

---

## 🤖 **Model Choice: Gemini 2.5 Pro**

**Why Gemini Pro:**
- 2M token context window (massive room for growth)
- Extremely powerful reasoning capabilities
- Excellent Arabic language support
- Future-proof - will get better over time
- Great cost/performance balance
- Superior quality for educational content

**Scaling Plan:**
- Start with last 30 lessons
- Can easily scale to 50-100+ lessons if needed
- Models will improve, context windows will grow
- Betting on this technology getting better (smart move!)

## 🎨 **UI/UX Design**

### **Chat Interface Location:**
**Hamburger Menu Approach** (☰)
- Three-line menu icon at top-left of student page
- Clicking opens a slide-out sidebar
- Sidebar contains full AI chat interface
- Can be opened/closed while staying on student page

### **Chat Sidebar Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 🤖 AI Tutor     ✏️  │ ← Header with Edit button
├─────────────────────┤
│ + New Chat          │ ← Create new session
│                     │
│ 📝 Chat Sessions:   │ ← Previous conversations
│ > Planning Ideas    │
│ > Homework Help     │
│ > Progress Review   │
├─────────────────────┤
│ [Message history]   │ ← Current session
│                     │
│ User: What next?    │
│ AI: Based on...     │
│                     │
│ Type message...     │ ← Input
└─────────────────────┘
```

### **Edit Curriculum Feature:**
- **✏️ Pencil icon** in chat header
- Clicking opens **modal overlay** with:
  - Full-screen textarea showing current methodology
  - User can edit their curriculum structure
  - Save/Cancel buttons
  - Changes save to their personal copy

---

## 🗄️ **Database Architecture**

### **New Tables:**

**1. `tutor_settings`**
- One row per user (unique)
- Stores: `teaching_methodology` (TEXT with default template)
- Each user automatically gets copy of default on first use
- User edits don't affect other users or the original default

**2. `ai_chat_sessions`**
- Multiple sessions per student
- Each session is like a separate conversation thread
- Fields: student_id, title, created_at, updated_at
- User can have multiple ongoing conversations

**3. `ai_chat_messages`**
- Messages within each session
- Fields: session_id, role (user/assistant), content, tokens_used, created_at
- Full conversation history preserved

### **Data Flow:**
```
User opens AI chat
  → Check if tutor_settings exists
  → If not, create with DEFAULT methodology
  → Load/create session
  → Fetch last 30 lessons for this student
  → Fetch message history for this session
  → Build full context prompt
  → Send to Gemini API
  → Save response to database
  → Display to user
```

## 🧩 **Teaching Methodology System**

### **The Default Template (You Create Once):**
- Curriculum structure (Level 1, 2, 3...)
- Teaching principles
- Common student challenges & solutions
- Assessment strategies
- Your teaching philosophy

### **Per-User Customization:**
- Each user gets automatic copy of your default
- They can click ✏️ to edit anytime
- Changes are isolated to their account
- They can see/use default or customize fully

### **Where It Lives:**
- **NOT in Settings page** (too hidden)
- **IN the AI chat interface** (contextual, accessible)
- Edit button right where they use the AI
- Modal overlay for editing (non-disruptive)

---

## 💬 **Session-Based Conversations**

### **Multiple Chat Sessions:**
- User can create multiple conversations
- Examples:
  - "Planning Next Month"
  - "Homework Ideas"
  - "Student Progress Analysis"
- Each session maintains its own history
- Switch between sessions easily

### **Session Context:**
- Each session sees the SAME last 30 lessons
- But different conversation histories
- Allows for focused discussions on different topics
- Can archive/delete old sessions

---

## 🎯 **AI Capabilities & Use Cases**

### **What The AI Can Do:**
1. **Suggest Next Lessons**
   - "Based on lessons 25-30, student is ready for quadratics"
   - Aligned with your curriculum structure

2. **Generate Homework**
   - Create custom homework for upcoming lessons
   - Matches student's current level

3. **Identify Knowledge Gaps**
   - "Student struggled with recursion in lesson 28"
   - Recommend review topics

4. **Plan Ahead**
   - "Here are the next 5 lessons I suggest..."
   - Based on curriculum progression

5. **Progress Analysis**
   - Track student's learning trajectory
   - Highlight strengths and weaknesses

6. **Answer Questions**
   - "What should I teach after linear equations?"
   - "How do I explain X concept better?"

### **Smart Context Awareness:**
- AI knows what was covered in last 30 lessons
- Can infer what was likely covered before (using curriculum)
- References specific lesson numbers in suggestions
- Understands your teaching methodology
