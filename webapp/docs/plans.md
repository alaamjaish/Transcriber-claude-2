> OK here's the thing I want you to do this the following right now as you can see you know my when I enter students page I only see the
  transcription thing and I then see the the I see the transcriber like the books that records and then the bottom I see the sessions this is     
  great but the aim of this is to help with tutor who's using the application the tutor who's using the application so we would like to use AI    
  right now to constantly like I would like to add a new section and before we do anything I just would like to think about it with you Yanni     
  like how to create this new section It's called Tutor will be interacting with AI at this point OK Tutor will have a chat bot with AI that is   
  gonna help him understand the status of his of his of his of a student things that they learn stuff like that etcetera And before we talk       
  about the tutor in the chat bot firstly I may basically I would like to see a new section that just allows the tutor to see the summary of the  
  last 3 I'm sorry the the summary of the last three summaries of the last three sessions you see we got a summary in the last 3SESSIONS and      
  like a summary in the last in each session there's a summary so I'd like to see a summary of summaries of the last three summaries every time   
  like I just entered a new session right now today and like I want to start recording so I'd like to know what what did I take with my student   
  last time the time before and the time before and the time before so I would like to see a prompt I would like I'm sorry to see a summary       
  within AI to like with an ability to chat with an AI about it for now let's just focus on the summary thing and how to do it and how to design  
  it just now don't code just show me the design that you propose for the page if maybe draw it right so that I can see it and then suggest a     
  way to do this with no harming for the system like and how to do this AI so that it only takes the last three things from like this AI should   
  always be fitted should always take should almost take the last three summaries of each student into it into its context window so that it      
  knows and gives me the summary that I want this is something that definitely I want to do it's going to help the tutors incrementally see the   
  life and the options that they can do So what do you suggest how do you suggest us building this how do you suggest the design first and what   
  do you think it's going to be a good idea to add don't code just write a very very good way to think about it I want your way to be lengthy     
  i've never coded in my life right just use high level explanation of how the new structure of the code will be happening like how are we gonna  
  do it and then show me the design you suggest for like Oh yeah the design will be like this we will have to be like this this will look like    
  this and it's always gonna update it and if you if the tutor like I wanna have the option and the tutor wants to talk with AI about the
  student this is maybe for the future like maybe a chat but with like immediately when I enter each page I find a summary that's generated       
  about the last 3 pages last three summaries like what happened those lessons very high level very like two lines maximum of summary It just     
  says last lesson we took this before this before this and what happened Yanni and then like the ability for the tutor to to talk with an AI     
  that I will train and I will give that about so that it knows exactly what's going on this is what I want you to be doing I really again don't  
  want to you to code now just show me the design and talk about the details in high level
